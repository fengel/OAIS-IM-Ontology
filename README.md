# OAIS-IM-Ontology

This section ilustrates OAIS-IM ontology that is developed based on OAIS IM reference model [1]. Whole OAIS IM [1] describes metadata that is used for
long term preservation of digital information. Figure 1 shows a part of OAIS IM logical model.

*Figure 1. A snapshot of OAIS IM logical model*


Classes from OAIS IM logical model that are shown in Figure 1 are expressed in the OAIS IM KB as concept names. Associations
between classes in from OAIS IM logical model are expressed
as roles names in the OAIS IM KB. Table 1 specifies DL
concept inclusion (CI) axioms including domain and range
restrictions on role names, subsumption relation between
concept names for each term name supported by the OAIS
IM from Figure 1.
